# Machine Learning

These are the assignments for [Coursera course](https://class.coursera.org/ml) taught by Andrew Ng (_as of 02.2018_). 

Assignments code is left unmodified in `master` branch - you can just fork the repo and have fun solving them. 
My solutions are in separate branches. 

#### Install Octave on Ubuntu
_Consult [Octave Wiki](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Debian_systems) for more details_ 

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:octave/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install octave
```

#### Run Octave in terminal

```bash
octave --no-gui

octave:1> cd ex1/ex1
octave:1> ex1

```
